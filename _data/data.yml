career-profile:
    title: Meteorologist, PhD in Science
    summary: |
      With a specialization in micrometeorology, I bring extensive expertise 
      in numerical weather and air quality models and the development of computational tools. 
      My professional interests include atmospheric boundary layer, 
      turbulence, transport phenomena, wind tunnel essays, atmospheric chemistry 
      and analytical solutions. My work is focused on advancing our understanding 
      of the atmosphere through innovative scientific research.

          Development of an algorithm to simulate the dispersion of gases 
          released by space vehicles at the Alcântara Launch Center. 
          Project with the purpose of developing a model to analyze, 
          before launching a rocket, the concentration of gases and 
          particulate matter, toxic or not, released due to the 
          thrust produced by the burning of fuel, solid or liquid.
            - Air Quality Modeling

          Simulation of the pollutant dispertion with chemical reaction in the
          atmospheric planetary boundary layer with transform techniques. 
          The main goal of this project was study the dispersion of polutants 
          including chemical reactions with an analitical model. The equation 
          of the advecion-diffusion-reaction was solved by the 
          GILTT (Generalized Integral Transform Technique) method, 
          and the analytical solution was evaluated.
